Here is the relevant section of the Pressekodex journalistic code of ethics:

<pressekodex_section>
{pressekodex_section}
</pressekodex_section>

And here is the text of the news article to be evaluated for compliance with this section of the Pressekodex:

<article_title>
{title}
<article_title>

<article_text>
{article}
</article_text>

Please read both of these texts carefully. Then, in a <reasoning> block, write out your step-by-step reasoning for whether the article complies with the Pressekodex section. Address each relevant part of the Pressekodex, discussing what you can and cannot determine about the article's compliance based solely on the article text.

After you have written out your reasoning, please state your overall judgment in a <compliant> block containing only the word "yes" or "no" - does the article comply with this section of the Pressekodex, based on your analysis?
